Interactive UX Technique Cards
==============================

At the 2014 University of Illinois WebCon, Melinda Miller (@melindamiller) and Cate Kompare (@catekompare) gave a talk on UX techniques.
Part of their presentation was a deck of 'UX Technique Cards', which have a problem description on one side and a UX Technique on the back. 
The idea is for an individual or a team to use the problem statements when starting a new project to identify their main areas of concern. 
The reverse sides of the cards will reveal strategies that are recommended for the project.

This project is a prototype of an interactive app version of the UX Cards. It is written in Backbone.js

There are no special requirements or dependencies to run the app. Simply load the index.html page in a browser. 

The cards are draggable, and droppable on the three priority areas. Use the buttons at the bottom to flip all cards, or click individual cards to flip.
